# Pipeline Documentation:
1. Image Subtraction: https://www.authorea.com/users/75900/articles/96044-image-subtraction-with-lcogtsnpipe
2. [Manual (beta)](manual.md) 

# Docker-compose Installation (recommended):
This is likely the quickest way to get the pipeline up and running and requires the least amount of installation.
In the following instructions, the database server and data directories will live locally on your computer, so they will persist outside the Docker.
The pipeline itself will run inside the Docker container and forward graphics to your local computer.

## Installation
These instructions only need to be run once, when you set up the pipeline.

   1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
        * Make sure to increase the amount of memory Docker can access (recommended 8 GB). This is needed for certain stages (like `-s cosmic`) to run. On Mac, press the Docker icon in the toolbar, then click Preferences, then Resources, and increase Memory to 8 GB.
   2. Install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
   3. (MacOS only) Install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org).
   4. (MacOS only) Install [socat](http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/). If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed, you can just run `brew install socat`.
   5. Allow X11 connections (may be only necessary on Linux): `xhost +`
   6. (Linux Only) Modify your X11 config files to allow TCP connections: 
        1. If you are running gdm or gdm3 for your display manager add the following to `/etc/gdm<3>/custom.conf`
        ```
        [security]
        DisallowTCP=false
        ```
        2. If you are running lightdm, add the following to `/usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-xserver-command.conf`
        ```
        [Seat:*]
        xserver-command=X -core -listen tcp
        2) /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
        This file probably won't exist, you may create it if it is missing.
        [Seat:*]
        xserver-allow-tcp=true
        xserver-command=X -listen tcp
        ```
        3. Reboot your machine after updating the necessary config file.
        4. To test your X11 setup run
        ```
        docker run --rm -it centos:7 /bin/bash
        yum install -y xorg-x11-apps
        xeyes
        ```
        If a window appears, your computer is configured correctly. You only have to do this once.
   7. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/LCOGT/lcogtsnpipe` and `cd lcogtsnpipe`
   8. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t lcogtsnpipe lcogtsnpipe`
   9. Set you environment variables to point to where you want to store data and catalogs are e.g. 
       ```
       export LCOSNDIR=/your/data/directory
       export LCOSNDBPATH=/your/data/directory/mysql
       ```  
       These directories do not need to exist. In fact, it is easier if they do not. Docker will automatically create them
       with the correct permissions. If you need to use a pre-existing directory, you may have to update the permissions using
       `chmod -R 777 /path/to/data/`. If you do not set these environment variables, they default to being in `data` and `mysql`
       in repo directory.
   10. Startup your "pipeline server" (this is really a couple of docker containers instead of a true virtual machine, but
       this mental picture is close enough).
       ```
       docker-compose -f lcogtsnpipe/docker-compose.yml up
       ```
       This will take over your current terminal. Eventually, the terminal will print that the mysql host is ready to 
       accept connections
   11. In a new terminal, log in to the pipeline container: 
       ```
       docker exec -it lcosnpipe /bin/bash
       ```
   12. From inside the container, initialize the database: `sh /lcogtsnpipe/init-db.sh`. You only need to run this command 
       the first time you setup the db.
   13. From inside the container, run 
       ```
       cd $LCOSNDIR
       mkdir -p lsc fts 0m4 floyds extdata standard/cat/apass standard/cat/sloan standard/cat/landolt standard/cat/gaia
       ```   
       This only needs to be done the first time you populate data in this directory. 

   You are now ready to use the pipeline!


## Use
Follow these instructions each time you want to use the pipeline.

   1. Make sure the MySQL server and Docker daemon are running.
   2. (MacOS only) Run XQuartz from the Finder.
   3. (MacOS only) Run this hack in the background to get the X11 forwarding to work: `socat TCP-LISTEN:6000,reuseaddr,fork UNIX-CLIENT:\"$DISPLAY\" &`
   4. (Linux only) Set you display environment variable to point to the docker connection using 
   ```
   export LCOSNDISPLAY=`ifconfig docker0 | grep 'inet ' | cut -d: -f2 | awk '{print $2}'`:0
   ```
   5. Make sure your `$LCOSNDIR` and `$LCOSNDBDIR` environment variables are set correctly. 
   6. From inside the `lcogtsnpipe` directory, run `docker-compose up`
   7. From a separate terminal you can enter the docker container using `docker exec -it lcosnpipe /bin/bash`
   8. Run your desired pipeline processing commands
   9. When you're done, type `exit` to leave the Docker container.
   10. To stop the set of docker containers (your "pipeline server"), use `control-c` in the terminal you ran `docker-compose up`.
   11. To fully remove the containers (though not your mysql or data directories), you can run `docker-compose down` in the `lcogtsnpipe` directory.

Note that you can access the mysql database directly by using `-h supernovadb` inside the lcosnpipe container.
You can access the database from your host machine, e.g. with sequelpro by setting the host to be 127.0.0.1 and the port to be
4306. We choose this port so that it does not conflict with and existing mysql installation.

 
# Manual Installation: Installing the Pipeline and Database
1. Install msql  
    1. Install MySQL server from: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/  
    **Note:** you donâ€™t need an Oracle account to sign up, there is a just start download link at the bottom of the page. Links from here were very useful: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/installing.html
    2. Additional notes for Mac users: I used the DMG for OS X to install. This installs things in /usr/local. You can see if mysql is installed correctly by going to System Preferences. There should be mysql icon. Clicking on this you can start a mysql server
2. Set mysql to only throw a warning (rather than an error) when inserting or updating empty values into fields without default values:

    ```
    mysql -uroot -p

    mysql> set session sql_mode = 'NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION';

    mysql> set global sql_mode = 'NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION';

    mysql> exit 
    ```

3. Create database called Supernova
    1. download supernova database: https://www.dropbox.com/s/b28k5dkbs3i48nd/supernova_2020-01-31.sql?dl=0
    2. Connect to mysql as root: 
        ```
        mysql -u root -p
        ```
    3. Create the supernova database:
        ```
        mysql> CREATE DATABASE supernova;
        ```
        Expected output: Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
    4. Create user supernova and grant privileges
        ```
        mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'supernova'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'supernova';

        mysql> exit
        ```
        Expected output: Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.01 sec)
    5. Create the supernova database and choose a password:
        ```
        mysql -u root -p *your-password* < *database-including-path*
        
        e.g. mysql -u root -p zenith < /Users/valenti/Desktop/supernova_2020-01-31.sql
        ```
    6. Check that the database structure has been loaded
        * Start mysql connecting to the supernova database as the supernova user and entering the password you just created
            ```
            mysql -u supernova -D supernova -p
            ```
            Enter password: \*your-password*
        * Check that the list of tables matches the list of tables matches the list in Appendix A
            ```
            mysql> show tables;
            
            mysql> exit
            ```
4. Prepare your pipeline environment using Anaconda
    1. If you do not already have it, download anaconda for Python 3 (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
    2. Add the astroconda channel to your conda search path:
        ```
        conda config --add channels http://ssb.stsci.edu/astroconda
        ```
    3. Create a conda environment called lcogtsnpipe for the pipeline that uses Python 2.7
        ```
        conda create -n lcogtsnpipe python=2.7
        ```
    4. Switch to your new lcogtsnpipe environment
        ```
        conda activate lcogtsnpipe
        ``` 
    5. install astroconda (for details https://astroconda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
        * If you are running mac OS <10.15 (catalina) then install with iraf:
            ```
            conda install iraf-all pyraf-all stsci
            ```
        * If you are running macOS >= 10.15 (catalina) then install without iraf and see Appendix B for 64bit IRAF installation instructions. Then:
            ```
            conda install stsci
            ```
    6. Install astroquery
        ```
        conda install astroquery
        ```
    7. Install mysqldb
        ```
        conda install MySQL-python
        ```
5. Install the pipeline
    1. Install git if you do not already have it (https://ucdavis.github.io/DS4S/#setup)
    2. Download the pipeline:
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/svalenti/lcogtsnpipe
        ```
    3. Switch to the correct version of the pipeline
        ```
        cd lcogtsnpipe
        git checkout exportpipe
        ```
    4. Install the pipeline:
        ```
        cd trunk
        python setup.py install
        ```
6. Set up directory for data and configuration file
    ```
    mkdir <your directory name>
    e.g. mkdir /Users/valenti/lco
    ```
7. Set LCOSNDIR environment variable either on the command line for a single session or in your .bashrc or .bash_profile file (this assumes you are using a bash shell) that points to where your data will live
    ```
    export LCOSNDIR=<your directory name>
    e.g. export LCOSNDIR='/Users/valenti/lco'
    ```
8. Set LCOSNPIPE environment variable either on the command line for a single session or in your .bashrc or .bash_profile file (this assumes you are using a bash shell) that points to your lcogtsnpipe git repository
    ```
    export LCOSNPIPE=<your directory name>
    e.g. export LCOSNPIPE='/Users/valenti/lco/lcogtsnpipe'
    ```
9. Create configuration file named configure in LCOSNDIR with the following lines:
    ```
    hostname           127.0.0.1
    database           supernova
    mysqluser          supernova
    mysqlpasswd        *your-password*
    proposal           ['']
    users              ['']
    triggerpass        ''
    extraobject        ['']
    skipobjects        ['auto_focus']
    proposalingestion  ['']
    ptfhost            ''
    ptfdatabase        ''
    ptfpasswd          '''
    ptfuser            ''
    ```
    **Don't forget** to fill in your password on the third line
10. Install vizquery: https://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/vizier/doc/cdsclient.html  
    **Note:** I had to sudo make install on my mac

# Testing your installation
1. Download test data: 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/o3ls0zcqd64f49f/snexdata_2020-01-30_07%3A37%3A02.455163_23_6139.tar.gz?dl=0
2. Add your test data to the Supernova database:
    ```
    ingesttar.py -f snexdata_2020-01-30_07-37-02.455163_23_6139.tar
    ```
    **Note:** if you run this more than once, it may delete your entry. Check that the photlco table has rows. If not, run a third time.
3. Create a standard star catalog for apass and sdss catalog for AT2020oi field
    ```
    comparecatalogs.py
    ```
    **Note:** if you run this more than once, you may need to use the -F option to force the script to look again for a catalog
4. Run cosmic ray rejection on the images:
    ```
    lscloop.py -e 20200101-20200129 -s cosmic
    ```
5. Generate a PSF model for images:
    ```
    lscloop.py -e 20200101-20200130 -f apass --catalog=$LCOSNDIR/standard/cat/apass/AT2020oi_apass.cat -s psf
    ```
    Where \<path-to-your-conda> is the path to your anaconda installation
6. Calculate instrumental magnitudes with PSF photometry, displaying output in DS9
    1. Open DS9
    ```
    ds9& 
    lscloop.py -e 20200101-20200129 -s psfmag --show
    ```
7. Find the zeropoint of the image:
    ```
    lscloop.py -e 20200101-20200130 -f apass --catalog=$LCOSNDIR/standard/cat/apass/AT2020oi_apass.cat -s zcat
    ```
    Where \<path-to-your-conda> is the path to your anaconda installation
8. Find the apparent magnitude using zeropoint
    ```
    lscloop.py -e 20200101-20200129 -s mag  -F -f apass --type fit
    ```
    **Note:** this step may give you a warning at the end: Error 1364: Field 'targetid' doesn't have a default value
9. Check the magnitudes you just calculated by plotting them
    ```
    lscloop.py -e 20200101-20200129 -s getmag --type mag --show
    ```
